# Tattoo Aftercare

#### Congratulations on your new tattoo!

Proper aftercare is essential to ensure your tattoo heals well and looks its best for years to come. Follow our professional aftercare instructions carefully, and don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

## Immediate Aftercare (First 24 Hours)

- Leave the bandage on for the amount of time your artist recommends (typically 2–6 hours). This protects your fresh tattoo from bacteria and friction.
- Wash your hands before touching your tattoo.
- Gently wash the tattoo with lukewarm water and a mild, fragrance-free soap to remove any ointment, blood, and plasma.
- Pat dry with a clean paper towel; do not rub.
- Apply a thin layer of the recommended aftercare ointment (like Aquaphor or a tattoo-specific balm). Don’t over-apply; your skin needs to breathe.

## Ongoing Care (Days 2–14)

- Wash the tattoo gently once or twice a day using mild soap and water.
- Apply a thin layer of unscented moisturizer or aftercare ointment 2–3 times a day.
- Avoid soaking the tattoo; no baths, hot tubs, swimming pools, or long showers.
- Wear loose, breathable clothing to avoid irritation.
- Do not pick, scratch, or peel any scabs or flaking skin; this can cause scarring or color loss.
- Avoid direct sunlight and tanning beds.

## Healing Timeline

Healing typically takes 2–4 weeks. Your tattoo may go through several stages:

- Days 1–3: Redness, swelling, and light oozing are normal.
- Days 4–7: Peeling and itching begin; this is a sign of healing.
- Days 7–14: Most of the peeling stops. Tattoo may look slightly dull or cloudy as skin regenerates.
- Weeks 3–4: Skin should be mostly healed. Moisturize regularly and protect with sunscreen.

## Long-Term Care Tips

- Keep your skin moisturized to preserve the vibrancy of your tattoo.
- Always use SPF 30 or higher when exposed to the sun to prevent fading.
- Stay hydrated and maintain healthy skin to keep your ink looking fresh.
